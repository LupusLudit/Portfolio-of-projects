# Portfolio of projects

> **Note:** This is a school project.

This repository serves as a **portfolio container** for my individual projects. It does **not contain any standalone code** itself, but instead organizes the projects as **submodules**. Each submodule points to a separate Git repository where the actual project code is stored.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a single point of access for all my portfolio projects.

## Projects

Each project is added as a **Git submodule**. To work with the projects, you can clone this repository with submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LupusLudit/Portfolio-of-projects.git
